# Lightbox-anything
Lightbox anything does what it says; Select element(s) you wish to show in a lightbox and this code does the rest.

## Installation
 - Download or clone files to your project
 - Make sure you have jQuery included in your project
 - Include lightboxAnything.js -file to your project

## Usage
 - Edit lightboxAnything.js-file with your preferred editor
 - Select elements you wish to show in a lightbox by adding some kind of selector to the array called 'itemsToLightbox'. You can do it with vanilla JS or with jQuery like I did.
 - Refres the page and try it.
 - If it is not working, there's either problems with your jQuery or browser.

## Modification
 - Lightboxes styles are set from the lightBoxAnything-file. Replace or modify them the way you feel like.

## Demo
 - You can see the demo from your-project-folder/Lightbox-anything/demo

### Notes
 - This plugin uses let and const -variable types.
